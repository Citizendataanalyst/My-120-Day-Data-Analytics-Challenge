Day 5/120 of My Data Analytics Challenge

Today’s task: Create a project idea bank and identify business problem I can solve with data.

A project idea bank means to build a personal collection of well-thought-out project ideas that you can use anytime instead of constantly wondering…What should I work on next?
Think of it like your idea savings account for projects.

So I built a project idea around a real business problem.

Project Title: Customer Support Performance & Satisfaction Analysis

Business Problem: Customers frequently complain, but management doesn’t know the root cause.

Many companies receive complaints daily.
But Instead of guessing, data can answer:
✔️ What are the most frequent complaint categories?

✔️ When do complaints peak?

✔️ Does response time affect customer satisfaction?

✔️ Which process gaps are driving repeated issues?

Data turns complaints into clarity.

Tools to be used: SQL and PowerBI
Stay Tuned ✨
