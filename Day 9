Day 9/120 of My Data Analytics Challenge

Today was all about going deeper into Excel’s analytical power.

I worked on:
• Building Pivot Tables for structured analysis
• Understanding data modeling relationships
• Creating KPIs using DAX measures in Power Pivot

On the surface, it sounds simple. But internally, I could feel the stretch.

DAX forced me to slow down.
Every time I got an error, I had two choices:
Frustration… or curiosity.

There’s something about writing a measure, getting an error, fixing it, testing it again… and then finally seeing it calculate correctly.

That moment when the KPI works exactly how you intended it’s satisfying in a way only data people understand.

What stood out today was how powerful proper modeling is.
Once relationships are correctly defined, everything becomes easier, cleaner calculations, more dynamic reporting, and better business insights.
