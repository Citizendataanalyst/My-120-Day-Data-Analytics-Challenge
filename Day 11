Day 11/120 – Guided Excel Project

From Analysis to Dashboard Thinking📈

I started building the dashboard after structuring it yesterday. And I realized planning gives you confidence, but execution exposes your gaps.

When I began placing the KPIs and charts, I noticed how much attention detail requires. Alignment. Spacing. Consistency. Small things, but they change everything. 

There were moments I had to redo things. Adjust formulas. Resize visuals. It wasn’t frustrating, just humbling.

Today wasn’t about finishing.
It was about refining.
And maybe that’s the real lesson of this challenge showing up even when the progress feels quiet.
