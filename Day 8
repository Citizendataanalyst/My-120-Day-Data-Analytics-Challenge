Day 8/120 of My Data Analytics Challenge

Today was not easy.

I was mentally stretched, distracted, and honestly tempted to postpone the task. But I reminded myself why I started this 120-day challenge in the first place. Growth doesn’t happen only on convenient days.

Day 8 was all about data exploration using a sales dataset in Excel, not just building charts, but actually understanding what the data is saying and what business problem it can solve.

What I worked on:
• Exploring sales trends across regions and products
• Cleaning and structuring the dataset properly
• Identifying patterns and possible performance gaps

Instead of just building a dashboard, I asked:

Which region is underperforming?

Which products drive the most revenue?

Where are there inconsistencies in sales performance?

What decisions could a business owner make from this data?

Even on stressful days, I’m choosing consistency over comfort.
Consistent daily effort adds up to meaningful growth.
On to Day 9.
