Day 4 of 120 
Today I did something uncomfortable but necessary.
It’s easy to say I know Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python.
But the real question is…
Can I execute confidently without guidance ?

I rated myself across:
• Excel
• Power BI
• SQL
• Python

Hard Truth:
Knowing a function is different from solving a business problem with it.
Understanding JOINs is different from analyzing messy real-world data.

Building a dashboard is different from delivering insights that drive decisions.

I realized my understanding of the tools is stronger than my ability to execute with them effectively, especially Python and SQL.

So now my focus is simple:
✔ More projects
✔ More timed practice
✔ More business-focused analysis
✔ Less passive learning
