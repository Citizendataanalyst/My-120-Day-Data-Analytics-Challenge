Day 10 of my 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today, I moved beyond formulas and into structure.

Instead of jumping straight into charts, I built the foundation properly:

• Clean Dataset sheet
• Structured Analysis sheet
• Separate Dashboard wireframe

I broke revenue down by:

Month 

Product Category

Customer Segment

State & Region

And while doing that, I caught myself asking different questions.
How do I calculate this?

Because this challenge is no longer about learning Excel functions.
It’s about learning how to think like someone who makes decisions with data.
