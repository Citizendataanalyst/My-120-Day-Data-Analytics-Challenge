# My-120-Day-Data-Analytics-Challenge
Day 3 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

I went back to one of my earlier projects, a Udemy Course Analysis Dashboard.

When I built it, I was proud of it.
It showed student trends, top courses, free vs paid distribution, and category breakdowns.
At the time, I thought that was enough.
Now, three days into this challenge, I see it differently.

Here’s what was missing:
1) I showed yearly totals but didn’t calculate growth rates.

2) Analyzed free vs paid courses but didn’t model revenue impact.

3) Displayed KPIs without clearly explaining them.

4) I presented insights without translating them into business decisions.

What I’m learning now is that data analytics goes beyond charts and totals. It’s about asking better questions.
